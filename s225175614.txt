seeing as we need to commit a text file I figured I would write this new versions updates:

- I Shortened the wireframe titles to reduce confusion while working on it

- I added notes for places were I thought we its important to notice the functionality 

- I also made small quality of life improvements such as removing repitated screens and numbering all the wireframes

I do also plan on adding a freeplane diagram for referencing the flow of the app
