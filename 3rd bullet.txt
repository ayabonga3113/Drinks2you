aspects of the initial idea which have not been captured by the requirements
int the ideas the eleborated on how the sign up process should go but in requirements the dont show the process. There was plans for making a following based system to follow other chefs/app users which is a great idea but this is missing in the final. A feedback system is missing completely from the final and finally there was a ingredient purchasing system mentioned but never implemented. Most of the non-functional requirements are missing from the final app preview.
